This is a simple calculator that can be used to calculate the theoretical time of various regions around the world. Write using Python in conjunction with Streamlit. China adopts the Eastern Eight Districts Time (Beijing Time) as the national legal time. However, China has a vast territory and many places have significant time differences from the legal time, resulting in unchanged timing. Using this calculator, you can calculate the theoretical time of the local area by entering Beijing time and the longitude of the region. Suitable for calculating time within China and also for calculating time around the world.
